# How js.html Gets Cloudinary Data and Embed.html or Services.js Data Get

### Row Answer:
Means they connect in the browser when all HTML document and embed.html document completely loaded then js.html script file load and then perform the task.

### Detail Answer:
Yes, exactly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the connection works in the browser:

#### Rendering the HTML:
- The `services.py` file generates the HTML for the video player using the `embed.html` template.
- The `embed.html` template includes the necessary data attributes (`data-cloud-name` and `data-video-url`) for the Cloudinary video player.

#### Including js.html:
- The `base_site.html` template includes the `js.html` script within the `{% block extrahead %}` block.
- This ensures that the `js.html` script is included in the HTML document when the admin page is rendered.

#### Loading the Page:
- When the browser loads the admin page, it first loads the HTML content, including the video elements generated by `embed.html`.
- The `js.html` script is included in the head of the HTML document, so it is loaded after the HTML content.

#### Executing the Script:
- The `js.html` script is set to defer, meaning it will execute after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
- The script waits for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure that all HTML elements are fully loaded before running.

#### Initializing the Video Player:
- The `renderAllVideo` function in `js.html` selects all video elements with the class `jh-video`.
- For each video element, it reads the `data-cloud-name` and `data-video-url` attributes.
- It then initializes the Cloudinary video player using these attributes.

### Summary:
- The `embed.html` template provides the necessary data attributes for the video elements.
- The `js.html` script is included in the `base_site.html` template and executed after the HTML document is fully loaded.
- The script initializes the Cloudinary video player using the data attributes from the video elements.

## File Structure or More Related Data:

### services.py:
- The `get_cloudinary_video_object` function in `services.py` renders the `embed.html` template with the necessary context data (e.g., `video_url`, `cloud_name`).

### embed.html:
- The `embed.html` template uses the context data to set the `data-cloud-name` and `data-video-url` attributes on the `<video>` element.
